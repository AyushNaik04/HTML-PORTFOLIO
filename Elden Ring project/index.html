            <h2>The lands between </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>"Lands Between" is a term from the video game Elden Ring, referring to the game's world. It's a vast and diverse landmass with varied biomes, from lush grasslands to a frozen, mountainous north, all dominated by the Erdtree. The name "Lands Between" is intentionally ambiguous, meant to evoke a sense of mystery and serve as an invitation to explore this new world. </p>
